      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Background and motivation for choosing the product:</strong> My name is Tyce Neu, and I am a Computer Engineering student at Mississippi State University, originally from Central Ohio. I plan to graduate in May 2025 and am actively pursuing a career in manufacturing, production, and quality assurance. The selection of the Philips Norelco 2100 Series S1560 electric shaver for this project stems from both a personal and professional interest in the inner workings of everyday consumer products, as well as a broader ambition to work with real-world electromechanical systems. With a growing curiosity about how mass-produced devices are designed, assembled, and optimized for market, I saw this product as an ideal case study. The S1560 is a widely available, affordable electric shaver with a compact system that encapsulates many of the challenges and considerations involved in modern consumer electronics manufacturing. From injection-molded plastic housings and integrated circuitry to precision blade alignment and power efficiency, this shaver provided a hands-on opportunity to explore how design meets function under strict cost and durability constraints.</p>

<p>Moreover, the choice aligns closely with my academic trajectory and long-term professional goals. I am particularly interested in design-for-manufacturing (DFM), iterative prototyping, and the processes that accelerate the transition from concept to functional product. Reverse-engineering the S1560 offers a tangible, real-world platform for studying the trade-offs that engineers must make—between usability, manufacturability, and material selection—all within the constraints of mass production. Through this project, I aim not only to develop technical fluency in analyzing physical components and internal assemblies but also to cultivate a mindset focused on efficiency, sustainability, and user-oriented design. These are the same skills and perspectives that I hope to carry forward into a career in advanced manufacturing and rapid prototyping, where the ability to deconstruct and reimagine everyday technologies is both a creative and practical asset.</p>

<h2>2. Product Market and Retail Information</h2>
<p><strong>Product history:</strong> The Philips Norelco 2100 Series S1560 was introduced as an entry-level electric rotary shaver, part of Philips’ long-running Norelco line. It was designed for users seeking a reliable, easy-to-use electric shaver at an affordable price. It featured self-sharpening blades, a pop-up trimmer, and a lithium-ion battery, typically offering around 35 minutes of shaving time per charge. It was positioned as a budget-friendly option with solid performance for daily use.</p>

<p><strong>MSRP and street prices:</strong> The manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) was approximately $39.99 USD. Over time, the street price varied depending on retailer and availability, typically ranging from $29.99 to $44.99 USD. Prices tended to drop during promotions, holidays, or through online marketplaces.</p>

<p><strong>Retail outlets:</strong> The S1560 was sold through a wide range of retail channels, including big-box stores like Walmart and Target, pharmacy chains such as CVS and Walgreens, and electronics retailers like Best Buy. It was also widely available through online platforms including Amazon, eBay, and Philips’ own website.</p>

<p><strong>Rebranded/OEM versions:</strong> While the S1560 was primarily marketed under the Philips Norelco brand in North America, similar models with minor cosmetic or feature differences were sold under different model numbers in international markets, such as the Philips Series 1000 line in Europe. However, no widespread OEM or third-party rebranding of this exact model is known.</p>

      <h2>7. Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>Working with the Philips Norelco Series 2100 S1560 PCB has been a challenging but highly rewarding experience. One of the biggest hurdles was dealing with the unfamiliar PCB layout and tracing the various components back to their specifications. This was complicated by the fact that many of the parts used in this product came from Philips' themselves, who have not disclosed much detailed information about their components or custom MCU, making it difficult to obtain reliable datasheets. In these situations, the importance of hands-on analysis became clear—sometimes, you must rely on visual inspection, measurements, and even trial-and-error to understand how a component fits into the broader system. <p>The most important takeaway from this project was understanding that, while a product might appear complex and flashy, its individual components often reveal that the design may be simpler than initially assumed. While the Norelco 2100 S1560 features a smooth, polished design with advanced materials like lithium-ion batteries and self-sharpening blades, the underlying electrical components are fairly standard and don’t require cutting-edge technologies. This realization taught me the value of deeply understanding each part within a product—sometimes the best solutions are found not in fancy features, but in the careful selection and integration of simple, reliable parts.</p> <p>Another crucial lesson was the importance of MOSFETs in the circuit. I was initially unaware of the full range of functions that MOSFETs could provide in a system, but during my exploration of the PCB, I learned just how versatile these components are. From voltage regulation to switching and protection, MOSFETs perform multiple roles that are fundamental to the product’s performance. The more I delved into their different functions and types, the more I appreciated their critical role in modern electronics. Understanding MOSFETs better allowed me to make more informed decisions when analyzing and modifying the circuit.</p> <p>This project has reinforced the value of persistence and problem-solving skills when dealing with hardware reverse-engineering. When faced with limited information, it’s important to approach the problem systematically, break down the components into manageable pieces, and continue learning throughout the process. The lessons gained here have not only enhanced my knowledge of PCBs and electronics but also highlighted the importance of looking beyond the surface of a product to understand its true capabilities and limitations.</p>
